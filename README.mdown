Visualising spatial Behaviour 
=============================
###using Moves app

this is a personal project on visualisation and analysis of
personal spatial behaviour using Moves app.

an current moment I use cartoDB service to visualise data.
Also, I use python 2.7, json and geojson modules to process data manually exported data. There is also an old code for aoutomated data collecting.

###Here are ongoing todos for the project:
- update all the places with their foursquare category, intepreted
- calculate the total time of being and scheldure of visiting different places and categories
- refine ordinal patterns of overday and week behaviour, probability and variability of place sequences
- refine error and bad trackers (long narrow lines, obviously incorrect)
- calculate deviation (veriability) of route times, and season corellation.
- Moves recognize the type of movements: running, cycling, riding a car, walking around, etc. So I can add those stats also.
- Visualise this data and add it to the map, or as a separate project.
